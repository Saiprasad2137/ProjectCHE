        </h2>
        <p>National parks in India are IUCN (International Union of Conservation of Nature) category II protected areas. India's first national park was established in 1936, now known as Jim Corbett National Park, in Uttarakhand. In 1970, India had only five national parks. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger in 1973 to safeguard the habitats of conservation reliant species and currently there are 106 national parks in India. Further legislation strengthening protection for wildlife was introduced in the 1980s.</p>
        <p>
            National sanctuaries,
             often referred to as national wildlife sanctuaries or wildlife reserves, are protected areas dedicated to conserving and safeguarding the natural habitat and biodiversity of various plant and animal species. These sanctuaries are established by governments to provide a safe haven for indigenous wildlife, offering a refuge where these species can thrive without the threat of habitat destruction, poaching, or other human activities.
             Important reasons for creating wildlife sanctuaries - 
            
            <p>1) Biodiversity Conservation</p>
            <p>2) Habitat protection</p>
            <p>3) Education and Awareness</p>
            <p>4) Climate change mitigation</p>
            <p>5) Preservation of cultural heritage</p>
        <h2>1. Jim Corbett National Park</h2>
        <p>
            Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park in India and was established in 1936.
            It is located in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand and is known for its rich biodiversity,
            including Bengal tigers, leopards, and elephants.In the early 1900s, several Britishers, including E. R. Stevans and E. A. Smythies, suggested the setting up of a national park on this soil. The British administration considered the possibility of creating a game reserve there in 1907.[9] It was only in the 1930s that the process of demarcation for such an area got underway. A reserve area known as Hailey National Park covering 323.75 km2 (125.00 sq mi) was created in 1936, when Sir Malcolm Hailey was the Governor of United Provinces; and Asia's first national park came into existence. Hunting was not allowed in the reserve, only timber cutting for domestic purposes. Soon after the establishment of the reserve, rules prohibiting killing and capturing of mammals, reptiles and birds within its boundaries were passed.
